The Odin Project - Project #3: Rock Paper Scissors

Another project created for The Odin Project course, where a user can engage in a Rock-Paper-Scissors game with a computer.
There are three matches - if you collect three wins before the computer does, you win. Otherwise, the machine wins.
Ties result in a point being given to both the user and the computer.

Cheers! :)
